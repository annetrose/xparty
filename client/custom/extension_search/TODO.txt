Todo List

* Understand when to use port messages vs. simple messages
* Load existing task response (if any)
* Load existing link rating (if any)
* Add tag cloud for class
* Maintain local copy of student's task history
* Update banner info in tab when tab is activated vs. notifying all tabs when something has changed
* Send messages from teacher to students  
     
 Bugs

* Some visited links may change tab id - need to detect and update tab id in stored data
* Direct links that redirect to another page will not be recorded as direct links
* Queries that display single page, instead of results page, will be recorded as direct links (e.g., fia)
* Web interface: In query/word panes in teacher view, multiple versions of student name (e.g., Anne/anne) 
  both show up sometimes until refreshed
