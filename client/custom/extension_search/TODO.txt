Todo List

* Change SP to XP in logos
* Understand when to use port messages vs. simple messages
* Load existing task response (if any)
* Load existing link rating (if any)
* Add tag cloud for class
* Maintain local copy of student's task history
* ?? Update banner info in tab on activate vs. notifying all tabs when something has changed
     
 Bugs

* Chrome appears to pre-load some pages which causes fake followed link to occur.
  An even bigger issue is that the tab id seems to change when the pre-loaded link is actually followed
  which breaks the extension
* Some visited links change tab id - need to detect and update tab id in stored data
* Direct links that redirect to another page will not be recorded as direct links
* Web interface: In query/word panes in teacher view, Anne/anne both show up sometimes until refreshed
