Todo List

* Change SP to XP in logos
* Understand when to use port messages vs. simple messages
* Show existing link rating (if any)
* Add tag cloud for class
* Maintain local copy of student's task history
* ?? Update banner info in tab on activate vs. notifying all tabs when something has changed
     
 Bugs

* In query/word panes in teacher view, Anne/anne both show up sometimes until refreshed
* Chrome appears to pre-load some pages which causes fake followed link to occur.
  An even bigger issue is that the tab id seems to change when the pre-loaded link is actually followed
  which breaks the extension; use document.webkitHidden to detect if page is visible?
* Some visited links change tab id - need to detect and update tab id in stored data
* Direct links that redirect to another page will not be recorded as direct links
* Handle searches that also generate a link followed automatically
* Some followed links may result in multiple urls getting recorded. Redirects?
* Link saved but banner.js does not receive saved message sometimes
    Doesn't happen often - maybe when extension is re-loaded and old banner.js is loaded in existing tabs?
    Could tabId change as a result of some page visits?
    Remove "saving/loading" messages from banner if no response received?
