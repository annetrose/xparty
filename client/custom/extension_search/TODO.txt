Todo List

* Change SP to XP in logos
* Understand when to use port messages vs. simple messages
* Show existing link rating (if any)
* Add tag cloud for class
* Maintain local copy of student's task history
* ?? Update banner info in tab on activate vs. notifying all tabs when something has changed
     
 Bugs

* Direct links that redirect to another page will not be recorded as direct links
* Handle searches that also generate a link followed automatically
* Some followed links may result in multiple urls getting recorded. Redirects?
* Link saved but banner.js does not receive saved message sometimes
    Doesn't happen often - maybe when extension is re-loaded and old banner.js is loaded in existing tabs?
    Could tabId change as a result of some page visits?
    Remove "saving/loading" messages from banner if no response received?
